# DrawWithYourEyes
A Meta Spark filter project template that allows you to draw by moving your eyes/ head. Created using two particle systems and head tracking.

Please note: This template is to give you the mechanism/ set up of the tracking and particle systems. The material differs slightly from what is illustrated here. Have fun!
